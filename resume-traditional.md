# Experience

## Self-employed {.detail}
*Freelance, since May 2017*

Worked as a design consultant for Escher Reality, a Y-Combinator backed startup 
making Augmented Reality (AR) SDKs. In addition to creating the brand identity, 
website and other collatorals, I designed single and multi user AR experiences 
in Unity for mobile that showcases the technology.

Designed and built animations for an LED matrix display (in Arduino) for a yet 
to be launched IOT device. The animations were designed to feel fluid and organic
with a goal of informing the user the current operational status of the device.

Worked with a team of consultants to use human-centered design methods to design
a business strategy for a major telecommunications company.
 
## Co-founder, Product and Experience {.detail}
*Echlo, since Jan 2016*

Worked on, as a co-founder, to develop a product based on the idea that location 
data is always available on mobile and can be used to foster better relationships
for the user. Created the product plan, market tested and iterated upon the initial
hunch with a set of test users. Designed all the brand, UI and UX elements and
implemented the Swift and web applications.

## Senior Program Manager {.detail}
*Microsoft, Oct 2011 - Dec 2015*

Worked as product owner for all compose related experiences in Outlook.com. I 
transitioned the core experience with the Hotmail to Outlook.com redesign, and
modernized the files and attachment experiences. Collaborated with other teams 
to create a cross platform experience and helped define the design system for 
Microsoft online services.

Worked on shipping new and refining existing features for Outlook.com around user
interface and email management. My approach typically includes defining key to 
drive the design of the feature, and prototyping and refining it based on user
feedback.

Collaborated with Research and Design in Office 365 to identify and prototype 
mobile application opportunities. The process involved foundational research,
ideation, validation and prototyping. Among them, I worked as the product owner 
for Twist, a photo communications app, leading the effort across research, design, 
engineering, legal and marketing from start to launch.
