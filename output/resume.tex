{\em Honeycomb, since Oct 2017}

\useURL[url3][https://www.honeycomb.io][][Honeycomb]\from[url3] is a
data viz and ops tool for developers debugging software services in
production.

As the first and only designer, I established Design at Honeycomb. My
key contribution is making a developer focused product approachable and
easy to use while making competitive and strategic product advancements.
This requires being empathetic to developers, understanding the market,
and shaping the product around complex tooling and workflows. My work
spans across the company, from planning, scoping, and feature execution
to brand to visual patterns and component libraries.
