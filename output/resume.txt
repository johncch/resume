Hello

I have 12+ years of experience leading and managing new product
innovation focusing on Design and UX.

-   Part of the Extended Senior Leadership Team, reporting to CEO,
    advising on all digital-related matters and exploring new digital

    based on extensive ethnography conducted on key patient population
    and stakeholders; collaborated across orgs to run pilot programs.

Product Design Lead

Honeycomb, Oct 2017–April 2019

Honeycomb provides observability to modern dev teams to understand and
debug production systems.

-   Redesigned product, IA and UI to advance observability use cases for
    teams, expanding from just queries to multiple feature areas and
    incorporating collaboration semantics into the product.

    technical product setup to reduce time-to-first value for new
    trials—to achieve self-serve business objectives.

CEO & Co-founder (Product development)

Echlo, Jan 2016–Oct 2017

Echlo explores productizing real-time geolocation. Our first app was
Pulse.

-   Designed, built and launched a multi-user, concurrent, persistent,
    location sharing mobile and web app in Swift and React. The app was
    designed to be always on with minimal battery use, achieved using a
    deep exploration into and understanding of the iOS tech stack.
-   Guided the product strategy from initial conception to later market
    search efforts using both qualitative and quantitative user research
    methods.

Senior PM (Product & UX)

-   One of few PMs working on UX, touching every product and feature
    from Inbox, to Sweep, to Compose. Worked on the Hotmail to
    Outlook.com redesign; eventually in the unification of email
    products, the Outlook.com UX became the defacto experience.
-   Led efforts to research, generate and develop mobile strategy and
    app ideas in an executive push for a mobile application strategy in
    Office 365.

    iOS App Store.
