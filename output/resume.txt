HELLO


I am a technologist with more than 9 years of experience managing and
building web and mobile products. I believe in human-centered and
thoughtful approaches to building better products.



EXPERIENCE


Co-founder, Product and Experience

_Echlo, since Jan 2016_

We believe that creating new opportunities to connect with friends help
foster better relationships. I was interested in a small agile team
setting as a means to find product market fit for new location-based
technologies.

-   Created a product plan and roadmap based on the initial idea, and
    performed product testing and validation over a small set of beta
    users.
-   Designed all the brand, UI and UX elements and implemented the UI
    for the iOS app in Swift.
-   Created a reusable CSS library and implemented the web apps in
    React, and created all public facing websites the company and
    product.


Senior Program Manager

_Microsoft, Oct 2011 - Dec 2015_

I leaned heavily onto human-centered design methods to conceive,
prototype and build improvements to existing well-loved products and to
explore new product opportunities for the company.

-   Product owner for all compose related experiences in Outlook.com. I
    transitioned the core experience with the Hotmail to Outlook.com
    redesign, and modernized the files and attachment experiences.
    Collaborated with other mail teams to create a unified experience
    and helped define our design system for the web.
-   Product owner for power user features such as Sweep and Rules for
    automatically managing emails.
-   Performed human factors work such as app animations and interaction
    models for contact picker, keyboard shortcuts and message list
    selection.
-   Collaborated extensively with Research and Design to prototype
    opportunities for lightweight apps in the Office 365 ecosystem.
-   Product owner for Twist, a reply-based photo app targeted at teens,
    working across research, design, engineering, legal and marketing
    from start to launch.


IT Specialist

_IBM, Aug 2008 - July 2010_

I joined IBM straight out of college and got a great education in

level device drivers and user interfaces. Ultimately, an opportunity to
both design and develop a customer facing app on a touch screen kiosk
kindled my love for UX.
