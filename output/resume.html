<h2>Product Designer (1st Design Hire)</h2>
<p><em>Honeycomb, since Oct 2017</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.honeycomb.io">Honeycomb</a> is a data viz and ops tool for developers debugging software services in production.</p>
<p>As the first and only designer, I established Design at Honeycomb. My key contribution is making a developer focused product approachable and easy to use while making competitive and strategic product advancements. This requires being empathetic to developers, understanding the market, and shaping the product around complex tooling and workflows. My work spans across the company, from planning, scoping, and feature execution to brand to visual patterns and component libraries.</p>

<h2>Senior PM (Product &amp; UX)</h2>
<p><em>Microsoft, Oct 2011 - Dec 2015</em></p>
<p>Product owner during the Hotmail to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2012/07/31/introducing-outlook-com-modern-email-for-the-next-billion-mailboxes/">Outlook.com redesign/rebrand</a> and was responsible for many of the features in the web UI, including compose, files, design and inbox management. The current version of the web client still retains most of the UX decisions that were made then.</p>
<p>Later, I led efforts to research and generate new mobile app ideas for Office 365. From that came <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/features/twist-a-new-microsoft-garage-app-encourages-creative-group-photo-banter/">Twist</a>, an exploration into social photo communications. I drove the planning, roadmap, and vision, partnering with stakeholders to bring the product from conception to launch.</p>
