# Hello
I've spent the last 10+ years exploring, building and managing digital products in both web and mobile. I believe that successful software has to be a cross-functional collaboration across all disciplines, from marketing to design to engineering.

# Experience

## Product Designer
*Honeycomb, since Oct 2017*

[Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io) is a series-A funded company that makes a data visualization tool that helps software engineers diagnose problems and debug software services with production data.

As the first and only designer, I established the design practice at Honeycomb. I've redesigned the product to be approachable and easy to use at the same time moving the product forward in a competitive marketplace. My work spans all aspect of design at the company, from planning, scoping and feature execution to marketing collaterals to design operations such as building out a visual and design system and components library.
 
## Co-founder
*Echlo, Jan 2016 - Oct 2017*

Cofounded Echlo to explore novel scenarios with real-time and persistent location sharing within social groups. The first product we shipped was an iOS app [Pulse](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pulse-find-where-your-friends/id1118545595?ls=1&mt=8). I was responsible for product planning, brand, UI and UX concerns and implemented the iOS and web applications.

## Senior Program Manager
*Microsoft, Oct 2011 - Dec 2015*

UX product owner during the Hotmail to [Outlook.com redesign/rebrand](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2012/07/31/introducing-outlook-com-modern-email-for-the-next-billion-mailboxes/) and was responsible for many of the features in the web UI, including compose, files, design and inbox management. The current version of the web client still retains most of the UX decisions that were made then. 

Later, I led efforts to generate new mobile app ideas for Office 365, and eventually saw the conception to ship effort of [Twist](https://news.microsoft.com/features/twist-a-new-microsoft-garage-app-encourages-creative-group-photo-banter/), a Microsoft Garage app tapping into photo communications.

## Self-employed
*Since 2000*

Performed design and development work for organizations of all sizes. Recent projects included consulting for [Escher Reality](http://www.escherreality.com), an YC-funded AR startup (since acquired) where I designed single and multi-user AR experiences and authored their first AR Human Interface Guidelines. In another project for [Phyn](https://phyn.com), as part of making the device feel responsive and smart, I defined and designed the interactive animations for the device's LED panel.

## Software Engineer
*IBM, Aug 2008 - July 2010*

Worked on an enterprise project for the largest [telco company](https://www.retailcustomerexperience.com/news/singtel-flagship-store-sets-the-bar-for-an-interactive-retail-experience/) in Singapore delivering ticketing flow and customer service software for both browsers and touch-screen kiosks.
