# Hello

I've spent 10+ years managing, building, and launching web and mobile products. I believe successful products come from user empathy, market positioning, and cross-functional collaboration.

# Experience

## Product Designer (1st Design Hire)

_Honeycomb, since Oct 2017_

[Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io) is a data visualization devops tool for developers to debug software services in production.

- Redesigned entire product for competitive and strategic advancements by listening to developers and analyzing the market. Users found the new design "clean" and "easy to use" despite complex workflows.
- Revamped user onboarding experiences, leading to reduced time to first value for new trials.
- Established design function for a technically-oriented, developer focused product. Led brand and product design vision, and collaborated with engineering and go-to-market teams on design support, feature launches, and working processes.
- Built credibility and brand equity with target audience by focused updates to brand and visual design.

## CEO & Co-founder (Product development)

_Echlo, Jan 2016 - Oct 2017_

Echlo was an exploration into productizing real-time geolocation. Our first app was &nbsp;[Pulse](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pulse-find-where-your-friends/id1118545595?ls=1&mt=8).

- Designed, built and launched a multi-user, concurrent, persistent, location sharing mobile and web app in Swift and React. The app was designed to be always on with minimal battery use. We achieved this using multiple strategies to acquire and cache the most useful, least expensive location.
