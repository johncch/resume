# Hello
I am passionate about building great products. I have more than 5 years of experience managing and building web and mobile products.

# My experience 
## Co-founder and Product
*Echlo, Since Jan 2016*

	We make Pulse â€“ an iOS app that uses location to make finding friends and going out easy. The product was developed off a core idea and iterated on with a small group of users. I designed all the brand, UI and UX elements, and implemented the UI for the iOS app in Swift. I created a reusable CSS library and implemented the web apps in React, and created all public facing websites the company and product.

## Senior Program Manager
*Microsoft, Oct 2011 - Dec 2015*

I was the product owner for all compose related experiences in Outlook.com. I transitioned the core experience with the Hotmail to Outlook.com redesign, and modernized the files and attachment experiences. I worked in tandem with other mail teams to create a unified experience and helped define our design language for web apps. I was also the product owner for the key marketing feature Sweep and other mailbox management tools such as Rules.

I am proud of the human factors work such as app animations and interaction models for contact picker, keyboard shortcuts and message list selection. I have strong working relationship with user research. It is important to validate all proposed work with prototypes before the team commits to it.

Later, I collaborated extensively with Research and Design to prototype opportunities for lightweight apps in the Office 365 ecosystem. I was the product owner for Twist, a reply-based photo app, working across research, design, engineering, legal and marketing, from zero to launch.

## IT Specialist
*IBM, Aug 2008 - July 2010*

I joined IBM straight out of college and got a great education in software engineering there. I had an opportunity to work on both low level device drivers and user interfaces. Ultimately, an opportunity to both design and develop a customer facing app on a touch screen kiosk kindled my love for UX.

## Freelance work

I've done various print, digital and web development work for organizations from amateur improv groups to startups.
