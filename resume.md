# Hello

I've spent 10+ years managing, building, and launching web and mobile products. I believe successful software comes from empathy, iteration, and cross-functional collaboration.

# Experience

## Product Designer (1st Design Hire)

_Honeycomb, since Oct 2017_

[Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io) is a data viz and ops tool for developers debugging software services in production.

As the first and only designer, I established Design at Honeycomb. My key contribution is making a developer focused product approachable and easy to use while making competitive and strategic product advancements. This requires being empathetic to developers, understanding the market, and shaping the product around complex tooling and workflows. My work spans across the company, from planning, scoping, and feature execution to brand to visual patterns and component libraries.

## CEO & Co-founder

_Echlo, Jan 2016 - Oct 2017_

Cofounded Echlo to make advancements in the real-time, persistent, location sharing space. Our first product is [Pulse](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pulse-find-where-your-friends/id1118545595?ls=1&mt=8). I built the product plan, brand, UI and UX from scratch, marketing and implemented the iOS and web app in Swift and React.

## Senior PM (Product & UX)

_Microsoft, Oct 2011 - Dec 2015_

Product owner during the Hotmail to [Outlook.com redesign/rebrand](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2012/07/31/introducing-outlook-com-modern-email-for-the-next-billion-mailboxes/) and was responsible for many of the features in the web UI, including compose, files, design and inbox management. The current version of the web client still retains most of the UX decisions that were made then.

Later, I led efforts to research and generate new mobile app ideas for Office 365. From that came [Twist](https://news.microsoft.com/features/twist-a-new-microsoft-garage-app-encourages-creative-group-photo-banter/), an exploration into social photo communications. I drove the planning, roadmap, and vision, partnering with stakeholders to bring the product from conception to launch.

## Software Engineer

_IBM, Aug 2008 - July 2010_

Designed and built software in C++, Java and JS on an enterprise project for the largest [telco company](https://www.retailcustomerexperience.com/news/singtel-flagship-store-sets-the-bar-for-an-interactive-retail-experience/) in Singapore delivering ticketing flow and customer service software for both browsers and touch-screen kiosks.

## Self-employed

_Since 2000_

Executed design, development and strategy work for organizations of all sizes. Recent projects included consulting for [Escher Reality](http://www.escherreality.com), a YC-funded Augmented Reality (AR) startup (since acquired) where I designed and built single and multi-user AR experiences in Unity and authored their first AR Human Interface Guidelines. In another project for [Phyn](https://phyn.com), I planned and designed the UI (through a 13x3 LED matrix) for the flagship device and built the corresponding animations.
